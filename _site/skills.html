					I am a passionate programmer with a strong desire to learn and grow. I have built websites/web applications, developed games with Android Studio, and created CLI tools with Java/Python. I have interests in quantum computing, A.I., and theoretical computer
					science. On my free time you can catch me skating or programming with my favorite language, Haskell. I am open and eager to learning new programming paradigms and taking on difficult challenges. I consider myself a Functional Programmer.
